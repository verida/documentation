# cheqd Credential Service

The Verida Wallet has full support for [Verifiable Credentials](./verifiable-credentials.md) issued by [cheqd’s Credential Service](https://docs.cheqd.io/identity/credential-service/get-started), a simple way of issuing Credentials over REST API.

Through this integration, the Verida Wallet can support storing, managing and verifying Verifiable Credentials signed by cheqd’s DID Method ([did:cheqd](https://docs.cheqd.io/identity/architecture/adr-list/adr-001-cheqd-did-method)), verifying credential revocation status using cheqd’s approach to status lists on-ledger (see [DID-Linked Resources](https://docs.cheqd.io/identity/architecture/adr-list/adr-002-did-linked-resources)) and soon, charging for revocation status checks.

Below is a diagram which explains how the cheqd and Verida stacks fit together.
