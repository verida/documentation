The protocol also maintains a [registry of smart contract addresses](https://github.com/verida/verida-js/blob/main/packages/vda-common/src/contract.ts) in code.

Verida currently operates all the storage nodes on the network while it measures performance and rapidly resolves issues during development.

We will soon be opening up storage nodes for third parties to operate.
